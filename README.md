The goal of this document is to help our contributors to understand what kind of documentation they can prepare and how should they write it.

## Creating Documentation for Dtube
If you think a page is lacking important information or there are some mistakes on it or you want to add something completely new that you think its going to be beneficial you will find many areas to work on.

Your documentation source should be written as regular Markdown files and should be easily convertable to HTML. If you want to contribute on any file to improve it please fork it first and send a pull request.
