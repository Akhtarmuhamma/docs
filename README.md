## Coding
If you don't know what to work on but want to help, please work on issues listed on each repository tagged as bug or enhancement.

However, it's also perfectly okay to submit pull requests for something you just want, even if it's not listed in the issues. Just understand that for this case not everything will get merged if it doesn't gather enough approval from other developers.

As you can see from the repos list, we try to use Javascript whenever we can to get a job done. This doesn't mean you cannot contribute in another programming language by creating a new repository.


## Design/UX

We will not accept raw designs (.pdf, .ai) as valid submissions. If you want to contribute to DTube's design. Please directly submit css/images changes to the appropriate repositories (UI or player), so that everyone can try it out inside the real product.


## Documentation

Documentation is a good way to get started on how to contribute. From fixing typos to better organizing our documentation or adding new documentation, you will find many areas where you can contribute.

*1* - Find a page that’s lacking important information or that has a spelling/grammar mistake

*2* -Locate the correct repository 

*3* -Edit the content from Github and submit a pull request.

You can always create new documentation that doesn't exist, if you think it will be beneficial to **Dtube**.
